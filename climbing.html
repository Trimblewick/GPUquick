	<h1>Whimps are getting ripped y'all </h1>
	<p> My best friend persuaded me into trying bouldering when we were in middle school. It was for sure fun but not as stimulating as it is for me now a days. I would try it on and off for years before getting hooked. Climbing started becoming more appealing to me after noticing that I all of a sudden was able to do <b>TWO!!</b> chin ups. I was late going into puberty and grew up being a whimpy kid. </p>

		  <p>My first 7A. A vertical dyno from a rather juggy hold to a flat edge. It turned out that the edge would scrape your palm unless caught. It would some what get into my head, "do not slip". </p>
		  <p>I was jumping to a hight which would suffice reaching the catching hold after about five trys. Ultimately it took me about 20 tries to commit and sending the problem. The fact that the dyno started relatively far up from the ground didn't bother me, at least not consciously. I am still trying to figure out what hindered me from focusing in on actually catching the hold. Feeling that I for sure could reach the hold made the jumps feel half hearted. Wether subconsciously fearing the hight or being afraid to cut up my hand will remain a mystery. </p>
		  <p>Not committing made me fall a lot which is bad for the knees and hips. So I guess I could use some mindfullness training or what not to ironically perserve the body unlike the usual which would be the soul.</p>

	  <p>On my first trip to Fontainebleau I expected myself to send a 6B and nothing tougher therefore this send was satisfactory to say the least. </p>
	  <p>Sandstone felt unusual yet pleasant being used to granite. The problems in font were technical in other ways that I was used to, but this particular problem suited my style prefectly. Upperbody strenght and not much else is needed. One beta is going feet first, but fuck that. I went straight for the ledge and pinched and pulled my way all the way to the top of the boulder. </p>

	  <p>This was a long time coming. On my first encounter with this problem it stood clear that this was my first nemesis. It would take about two years before seeing myself sending it.</p>
	  <p>A rather beta sensitive traverse goes into two half dynamic moves. One swingy move out to the left and ending with a rad mantle (as the name suggests).</p>
