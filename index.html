	<h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This is my own personal website for putting my thoughts out. This website is hand-coded in html, css and javascript and that is the reason for it looking like a website made from a time before I was born. I am a software engineer from Sweden and grew up in a academic town called Lund.<br>
        <p>Here are some pilars of realizations that currently construct my wisdom. Hopefully some of it can inspire the reader.</p>
	<h2><b>You shall not be boring</b></h2>
	<p>My motto, derived from the movie <i>Yes man</i> which in fact changed my life for the better. For me it is a way out of my comfort zone.</p>
	<h2>Don't think that you are special</h2>
        <p>You are not. People do not care for your creations nor success.</p>
	<h2>Hardly ever lie to children</h2>
        <p>Children understand and withstand more than some believe. Before lying to children, stop to think about the concequences, because it could hurt them more in the long term. It is possible it could be a missed oportunity for a good or even harsh life lesson.<br>
        <b>"Don't be stupid. Of course it is santa, I've known him for years!"</b><br>
        If they figure out santa claus is an imposter, one could let them have a proud win instead of going out of their way to convince them otherwise. </p>
        <p>Children anticipate their parents divorce, without being quite able to put their finger on it, way earlier than their parents come to realize. Before having it made clear to them in three small but difficult words, the kids must go about wondering why their environment is so miserable, somtimes for years.</p>
        <h2>The different perspectives of privelege</h2>
        <p>You cannot begin to imagine how it was growing up with different wealth. It goes both ways.</p>
        <p>I have for a long time been aware that I was raised outstandingly priveleged. It was subtly made clear to me by older relatives, even before I had a good concept of moneys worth. It plagues me that I wouldn't like to have it any other way.</p>
        <h2>Someone who does not want to be helped can not be</h2>
        <p>Don't put energy into a lost cause. Be weary of the time where the tide turns.</p>
