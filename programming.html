	<h1>The stereotypical programmer</h1>
	<p>
	The stereotype of programmers programming all the time even when getting home from work, does not stand true. I work as a software engineer, making embedded systems in C. <br/>
	When programming in my free time I program games, graphics and small computer vision applications. The majority of the code will be in C++, with some C# and python scripting.
	</p>
	<h2>Code that is fast and slow</h2>
	<p>
	The initial idea for this website was to upload small independent systems that fit in loops in a rendering engine. What I realized early during college was that people in general, are <b>NOT</b> interested in following and processing indepth tutorials. So fuck that. I am a junior developer and this code is probably, at best, pretty bad. I reckon I will cringe reading code here in just a couple of years. <br/>
	With that said, some generic scripts that I find myself using alot can be found here. Some solutions to problems that I find cool can also be found here. The code will be handcoded by me and unlicensed.</p>

        <p>Electronics are complicated. Electrical current is not read as 1 or 0, it is parsed into 1 or 0 from some threshold on the measured current. From my understanding of harddisks, the stored values in a magnetic segment on the disk could be interpreted as a value between zero and one. Is the value bellow or higher than 0.5 is what determens if the bit was 1 or 0. A read error occurs when the value 0.49 is misread as 0.51, which parses the bit to 1 when it should have been 0.
        Some batches are more reliable than others. Some mechanical harddrives never fails, and some do after just a year.</p>
        <p>The read error becomes "unrecoverable" when reconstructing the redundancy of the raid array onto a spare disk. The recrated data is simply corrupted when one of the bits are misread.</p>
